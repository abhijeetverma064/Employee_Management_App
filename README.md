# Employee_Management_App

It consists two parts:

1. sprintboot-backend (server) – To develop REST API
2. react-frontend (client) – Consume REST API

In this project, I build a full-stack web application that is basic Employee Management Application with CRUD features:

• Create Employee 

• List Employee

• Update Employee

• Delete Employee

• View Employee
